# _Hi, I’m Débora!_ 
- I just started my journey at `Inteli` ✨Institute of technology and leadership✨ as a student
- I'm into creating `high quality, timeless and beautiful` solutions through tech
- I'm a `Certificate Notion Creator` - a work that introduced me to coding, so let's get in touch if you like it!
- I'm also a `passionate contemporary and ballet dancer`, and love to balance my time with art and movement!!
- My Inteli buddy is also a dear friend, come meet `Mariana`: https://github.com/marimari0945
